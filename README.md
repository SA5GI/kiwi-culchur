Title:
Recalled 

Statement:
This project’s all about those streets that stick in your mind — the ones tied to memories or random moments you don’t forget. Growing up in a small town in Belarus, I still remember the old European road signs I’d see on the way home. Since moving to Aotearoa, I’ve noticed how different the signs look here, but they carry meaning too. “Recalled” is an interactive web poster where people can type in a street that means something to them — and watch it drop into the scene like it’s landing back in memory.


AI:
I used AI to help me build the physics and interaction side of the poster — making signs fall, bounce, and disappear when clicked. It also helped me with fixing any bugs during the process of creating the web. 

Typeface:
Europa Bold — I picked this typeface because it feels strong, simple, and nostalgic. It reminds me of old street signs, and is very modern
